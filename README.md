# WeMeditate

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind WeMeditate came from the increasing need for balance in our daily lives as MCIT students. With demanding schedules and constant digital distractions, we noticed many people struggle to prioritize mindfulness and overall wellness.

## What it Does

WeMeditate is an iOS app that empowers users to take control of their wellness journey. The app provides guided meditation sessions, allowing users to select a suitable time and meditation type to improve their mental and emotional health. It acts as a daily companion to help users de-stress, stay mindful, and build long-lasting healthy habits.

## How We Built It

We developed WeMeditate using Swift and Xcode for the iOS platform. The user interface was designed with SwiftUI to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly experience. We also incorporated animations and transitions to enhance the immersive experience and ensure seamless navigation.

## Challenges We Ran Into
	•	UI/UX design: Creating an aesthetically calming design while maintaining intuitive navigation.
	•	Time constraints: Building a polished app in a short timeframe (2 days) required prioritizing tasks effectively.


## How to Run the Program
	1.	Clone this repository to your local machine:
	2.	Open the project in Xcode.
	3.	Use the simulator in Xcode.
	4.	Build and run the app by pressing the Run button or using the shortcut Cmd + R.
